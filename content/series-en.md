[clojure.core] is a series of blog posts about all the useful tools in
`clojure.core`, the cornerstone of Clojure's rich standard library.

:series/description

clojure.core is the cornerstone of Clojure's rich standard library. It houses a
plethora of useful small functions. By combining enough of these generic
functions, you can solve a wide range of (domain-specific) problems with very
few custom abstractions. A good overview of what clojure.core has to offer is,
in many ways, the key to succeeding with Clojure. In this series of blog posts,
we highlight some gems, hoping that you too will agree with the following quote:

> It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10
> functions on 10 data structures.

[Glimpses of Datomic] is a series of blog posts about the exciting and peculiar
database Datomic.

:series/description

Datomic is a fascinating database. It was designed from the ground up by Rich
Hickey in 2010 — after he created a new programming language specifically to
realize his ideas. Some limitations have disappeared in the 40 years since
traditional databases were designed. For those of us who were brought up on SQL,
it’s exciting to see how differently one can think about storing and retrieving
data. Here at Team Mat, we have had the pleasure of working with the database
since it was launched in 2012. Join us and get a glimpse of Datomic too.

I've written more about [full text search] in this series of blog posts.

:series/description

Full-text search can seem magical. What exactly is happening when I get a hit on
"clown research" after searching for "research"? Through these blog posts, I
hope to find out by building a simple search engine from scratch in JavaScript.
The result will be good enough to use in production on
[modest](https://www.matvaretabellen.no/) [data
sets](https://smilefjes.mattilsynet.no/) (a few thousand documents).

[Useful to Know About NATS] is a series of blog posts about the distributed
messaging system NATS.

:series/description

[NATS](https://nats.io) is a distributed messaging system with many usage
patterns: from pub/sub, work queues, and streaming of persistent logs to
key/value and object storage. All from the same primitive, subject-based
messaging.

NATS is written in Go and is thus distributed as a fast standalone binary. It
has an implementation of the [Raft consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/)
for distributed persistence with replication.
