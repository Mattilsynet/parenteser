There are many things I wonder about this picture. Why was there a pillow in the
office during our professional development day? Why did I pick it up? Am I
encouraging a pillow fight, or are there darker undertones in this seemingly
cheerful image? After this blog post, thankfully, there's one less thing I
wonder about: How do you create such responsive images again?
